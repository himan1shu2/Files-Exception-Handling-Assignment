        "1.What is the difference between interpreted and compiled languages?\n",
        "  - Compiled Languages:\n",
        "     - Code is translated before running by a compiler into machine code.\n",
        "     - Faster execution.\n",
        "     - Examples: C, C++, Go\n",
        "  - Interpreted Languages:\n",
        "     - Code is executed line-by-line at runtime by an interpreter.\n",
        "     - Slower, but easier to test and debug.\n",
        "     - Examples: Python, JavaScript, Rub   \n",
        "\n",
        "2.What is exception handling in Python?\n",
        "  - Exception handling in Python is a way to manage errors during program execution without crashing the program.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Key Keywords:\n",
        "    - try: Code that might cause an error.\n",
        "    - except: Code that runs if an error occurs.\n",
        "    - else: Runs if no error occurs.\n",
        "    - finally: Always runs (error or not).\n",

        "  - The finally block in Python is used to execute code no matter what—whether an exception occurs or not.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Purpose:\n",
        "     - Clean up resources (like closing files or database connections)\n",

        "   - The __del__ method in Python is a destructor. It is called automatically when an object is about to be destroyed (i.e., garbage collected).\n",
        "\n",
        "   - Purpose:\n",
        "     - To clean up resources (like closing files or network connections)\n",

        "       - Use it carefully—Python’s garbage collection timing isn’t always predictable.\n",

        "                   print(\"Cannot divide by zero\")\n",

        "13.Why is memory management important in Python?\n",
        "  - Prevents Memory Leaks\n",

        "\n",
        "  - Improves Performance\n",
        "    - Frees up unused memory so it can be reused.\n",
        "    - Optimizes resource usage.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Simplifies Coding\n",
        "    - Python handles memory behind the scenes using garbage collection and reference counting.\n",
        "    - Developers don’t need to manually allocate or free memory.\n",
        "\n",
        "   - Supports Large Applications\n",
        "     - Efficient memory use is crucial in big programs or data-heavy tasks.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Avoids Crashes\n",
        "    - Poor memory use can cause programs to crash or slow down.\n",

        "14.What is the role of try and except in exception handling?\n",
        "  - Role of try:\n",
        "       - Used to wrap code that might raise an error.\n",

        "  - Python Garbage Collection (GC) in Short:\n",
        "    - Reference Counting:\n",
        "      - Every object tracks how many references point to it.\n",
        "      - When the count reaches zero, the object is deleted.\n",
        "\n",
        "    - Cycle Detection:\n",
        "       - Python can detect reference cycles (objects referring to each other) using the gc module.\n",
